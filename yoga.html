                    History of International Yoga Day
                    <br>
Yoga is a centuries-old practice that originated somewhere around 5,000 years ago in India. This was looked up as a process and technique to interconnect the mind, body and soul together and take a step closer to enlightenment. As this practice gained popularity in the West, this started to be termed an exercise and relaxation method. This was also associated with the claims to alleviate any existing physical injuries and chronic pains.
                    <br>
The idea to mark June 21 as International Yoga Day was first proposed by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 27, 2014. It was during his UN General Assembly speech where the resolution was introduced by India's Ambassador, Asoke Kumar Mukerji, to June 21 as International Yoga Day.
                    <br>
On June 21, 2015, i.e., when this day was first celebrated, more than 36,000 people from all over India joined Prime Minister Modi to perform 21 yoga postures, also called asanas, for 35 minutes at Rajpath, New Delhi. Shri Narendra Modi was further joined by other high-profile political and famous leaders across the globe.
