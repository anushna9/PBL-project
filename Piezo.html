                    PIEZO-SHOES FOOT-POWERED ENERGY HARVESTING INSOLES AND SHOES FIELD OF THE INVENTION
                    <br> This invention relates to power generation via peizo electric material for the use of charging batteries and portable electronics. 
                    <br>
                    BACKGROUD OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART 
                    <br>
                    Access to mobile power source is becoming a necessity for portable electronics users. The need to charge portable electronics like cell phones, radios, GPS, or entertainment devices has been met with backup battery and solar powered solutions. Many people around the world have access to cheap, portable electronics but lack a suitable means to charge them. Foot-powered, peizo electric energy harvesting solutions are renewable and universal solutions to on-the-go charging needs. A charging system based on the present invention could be used in a variety of applications including being placed in insoles and embedded in shoes for charging mobile electronics. These applications include but are not limited to communication devices, medical, and survival equipment, location/tracking equipment, sensors, and media electronics. By using peizo electric material potential amount of energy can be generated with negligible maintenance. The device produces electricity when the heel strikes the ground. Thus with each step electricity is produced. This technology has a number of advantages over the mechanical and micro-fluidic energy harvesting systems of prior art as they require a lot of maintenance. The sole embedded with this material can be manufacture according to individual’s foot sole to get optimum results and comfort. The mechanism also has applications in the consumer market for trail and mountain-based sports. Many people are limited in their range of expedition due to lack of battery life in devices such as GPS, radios and other equipments. The mechanism serves as a way to charge these electrical devices from a serviceable power grid. The device will enable users to carry fewer batteries while they are on extended trips away from any power sources. These shoes/insoles can also be used as a means to supply power to remote areas in third world countries. Including but not limited to lightening at night, communication, and various tools. In addition to being a shoe, it can be developed into sandals in underdeveloped nations. 
                    <br>
                    It serves as a portable energy source.
                    <br>
                    It powers small electronic gadgets like mobile phone, torch, GPS, etc.
                    <br>
                    It solves the problem of eco-friendly energy generation.
                    <br>
                    Can be used in monitoring individual’s health parameters like blood pressure, pulse rate, etc.
                    <br>
                    It proves as a most efficient energy source in remote areas, a very friendly device for hikers and explorers.

                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
                    <br>Most portable devices like cell phones and laptops require electronic power. It can be inconvenient and expensive to constantly need to find a power supply or carry backup batteries. The enclosed invention solves this problem by harvesting energy from step. The invention is based upon the principle of peizo-electric effect. “Peizo-electric effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress.” The developed mechanism consist of sheets embedded with piezoelectric crystals (FIG.2.1) arranged in a definite pattern as shown in FIG.3. This pattern allows us to obtain maximum voltage. All the sheets are installed with these crystals in accordance with the FGP pattern of the individual to obtain maximum energy. The overall assembled view of the invention is shown in figure 1. The peizo-electric sheets are arranged in layers, the battery box and the convertor circuit is present in the heel section. A variety of piezoelectric materials are available in the market. The most easily available and cost efficient material is PZT-Lead Zinchronate Titanate. The material used for making the sheet would be synthetic fabric and the heel section is made up of either aluminum or hard plastic casing. Working of the invention: The process starts with a human effort of walking as the foot strikes the ground, the pressure is applied on the peizo-electric sheets. Thus due to deflection in the sheets results in the development of electric charge. The output of the sheets is AC (Alternating Current). Thus it is needed to convert into DC (Direct Current) for storing it into a battery. The converting circuit consists of a Bridge rectifier comprising of four diodes arranged in a pattern and a capacitor for amplifying the output. The capacitor also provides a continuous supply to a battery. The battery is used to store charge while walking which can be further extracted using a USB output. For an AC output we can also attach an AC to DC convertor. Additional equipments can be added to the invention such a GPS or Blood Pressure sensor to increase its usability.       EXAMPLE OF INTENDED USE The present invention has an application in foot-ware industry. The insoles can be manufactured according to individual’s ground pressure foot print for increasing the comfort and the output in each step. The people who are in constant travel need a trustable energy source to charge their devices. This invention can prove very useful to the ones who are in remote areas like a village in third world country or in a forest. The present invention has it applications in space industry as it don’t have any moving part and is light in weight unlike other systems of prior art. It will be very effective if someone is on planet mars and need to charge his suits. Well Peizo-electric shoes have a variety of applications in today’s modern world.
